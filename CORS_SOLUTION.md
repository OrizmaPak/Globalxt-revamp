# CORS Issue Solution & Current Status

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issue**
Vercel deployment has authentication protection enabled, causing CORS errors when accessing the API from your React app.

## âœ… **Current Working Solution**
I've implemented a **hybrid approach** that:

1. **Tries the API first** - Attempts to send via the Vercel API
2. **Falls back to mailto** - If API fails due to CORS/authentication, it opens the user's email client with a pre-filled professional email

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works Now**

### Primary Attempt (API):
- Tries to send via: `https://global-xt-llpvvp5z7-orevaorior-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/api/send-enquiry`
- If successful: Shows "Enquiry Sent Successfully!" 
- If fails: Automatically falls back to mailto

### Fallback (Mailto):
- Opens user's email client (Outlook, Gmail app, etc.)
- Pre-fills professional email to `globalxttech@gmail.com`
- User just needs to click "Send"
- Shows "Enquiry Ready to Send!" message

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result**
Your enquiry form **will always work** regardless of API issues!

## ðŸ”§ **To Fix Vercel CORS (Optional)**

### Option 1: Disable Vercel Protection
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your `global-xt-api` project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Deployment Protection
4. Disable protection or add your frontend domain to allowed origins

### Option 2: Alternative Deployment
Deploy to a different service like:
- Railway.app
- Render.com  
- Heroku
- Or run locally

### Option 3: Use Current Solution
The mailto fallback is actually quite user-friendly and professional!

## ðŸ“§ **Email Format**
Both approaches send the same professional format:

```
